# ED-ShieldsBasic
A mod for the Game Rimworld

Original Description from Jaxxa:
This mod allows you to place shield generators. They are expensive and power hungry but can really strengthen your defences. The standard shields will stop projectiles that try to enter it, but allow weapons to be fired out.

From Jetpack_Maniac:
This mod has been patched to work with Combat Extended for Rimworld A17.
