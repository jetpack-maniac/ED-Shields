Original Description from Jaxxa:
Discussion, Non Steam Downloads and GitHub Repositories of this mod is available at: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=18995

This mod allows you to place shield generators. They are expensive and power hungry but can really strengthen your defences. The standard shields will stop projectiles that try to enter it, but allow weapons to be fired out.
